# Expressions
 A project created as a college job, where we has to convert infix to postfix. But, what exactly the program does ? Well...
 
 This tool gives you a way to change between infix (seen normally in most writing) and post fix also known as reverse polish notation or Polish postfix notation which is used in some HP calculators such as the 9100A and HP-35.

**The converter supports +.-.*. / and ^.**
